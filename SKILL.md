  CK3 modding skill for Crusader Kings 3. Use when creating, editing, or debugging
  CK3 mods, writing Paradox Script, working with events, decisions, traits, CBs,
  GUI, localization, buildings, or any CK3 game files. Also use when the user mentions
  Crusader Kings, CK3, Paradox Script, mod development for CK3, or asks about
  triggers, effects, scopes, on_actions, or scripted_effects in a CK3 context.
  Also activate for mod compatibility questions between CK3 mods.
  Activate even for seemingly simple CK3 scripting questions — Paradox Script
  has many non-obvious pitfalls that require consulting reference documentation.

# CK3 Modding Skill

Paradox Script is a proprietary DSL used by Crusader Kings 3. It is poorly documented
and full of non-obvious pitfalls. This skill provides reference documentation,
actionable recipes, and utility scripts for CK3 modding.

## Golden Rule

Never invent triggers, effects, scopes, or Paradox Script syntax.
Always consult the relevant .info file in references/info/ before writing code.
Verify against: .info files > script_docs > vanilla game files > patterns.
Do NOT use web search unless the user explicitly requests it.

## Source of Truth Hierarchy

```
1. .info files (references/info/)          — Paradox's own syntax documentation (~166 files)
2. script_docs (references/script_docs/)   — Generated trigger/effect/scope/modifier lists
3. Vanilla game files ($CK3_GAME_PATH)     — Real implementations and patterns
4. Patterns (references/patterns/)         — Actionable recipes with pitfalls
```

The .info files are THE definitive reference for syntax. They document every key,
type, and valid value for each system. Always check the relevant .info file before
writing code for a system.

script_docs are the exhaustive list of all effects, triggers, scopes, and modifiers
that exist in the game. When unsure if a trigger/effect exists, search script_docs.

## Configuration

This skill expects the following paths. Ask the user to provide them if not set:
- CK3_GAME_PATH: path to the CK3 game/ folder
- CK3_USER_PATH: path to Documents/Paradox Interactive/Crusader Kings III/
- CK3_MOD_PATH: path to the current mod being worked on

First-time setup instructions: read references/setup.md

## Quick Navigation

### I need the official syntax for a system
- Check: references/info/common/<system>/_<system>.info
- Full list: references/info/ (synced from game via scripts/sync_info.sh)
- Sync: `./scripts/sync_info.sh`

### I need to look up a trigger, effect, scope, or modifier
- All effects with syntax and scopes → references/script_docs/effects.log
- All triggers with syntax and scopes → references/script_docs/triggers.log
- All event targets (scope transitions) → references/script_docs/event_targets.log
- All valid modifiers → references/script_docs/modifiers.log
- All scope types → references/script_docs/event_scopes.log

### I want to create / modify something
- Create an event → references/patterns/events.md
- Create a decision → references/patterns/decisions.md
- Create a trait → references/patterns/traits.md
- Create a building → references/patterns/buildings.md
- Create a scheme (murder, seduce, etc.) → references/patterns/schemes.md
- Create a court position → references/patterns/court-positions.md
- Create an activity (feast, hunt, etc.) → references/patterns/activities.md
- Create a character interaction → references/patterns/characters.md
- Create a casus belli → references/patterns/casus-belli.md
- Modify culture/religion → references/patterns/culture-religion.md
- Modify the GUI → references/patterns/gui.md
- Add graphical assets → references/patterns/gfx.md
- Add localization → references/patterns/localization.md
- Set up a new mod → references/patterns/mod-setup.md

### I want to understand game structure
- Vanilla folder tree → references/structure/vanilla-tree.md
- Load order and overrides → references/structure/load-order.md
- Debug an error → references/structure/common-errors.md

### I want to check mod compatibility
- Compatibility patterns → references/compat/compatibility.md
- Run: `./scripts/check_compat.sh /path/to/mod_a /path/to/mod_b`

### Useful Commands
```
# Sync .info files + script_docs from game (run once after install/update)
./scripts/sync_info.sh

# Search for a trigger/effect in script_docs
grep -n "<term>" references/script_docs/effects.log references/script_docs/triggers.log

# Search for a trigger/effect in vanilla game files
grep -rn "<term>" $CK3_GAME_PATH/ --include="*.txt" | head -20

# Search with context (3 lines before/after)
./scripts/find_examples.sh $CK3_GAME_PATH "<term>"

# Index all vanilla files
./scripts/index_vanilla.sh $CK3_GAME_PATH

# Check compatibility between two mods
./scripts/check_compat.sh /path/to/mod_a /path/to/mod_b
```
